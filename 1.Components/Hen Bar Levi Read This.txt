//intialization for creating angular 2 project:
//1.install node js (check if node installed by write in the cmd:node -v)
//2.TypeScript - a superset of JS that adds new features to the lanugage (modules,classes,interfaces and more)
//to install TypeScript globally - in Cmd : npm install -g typescript
//3.in order to create a quick project folder structure with basic angular2 project files
//and packages we extract from the zip file in the 'Angular 2 Step by Step/angular2-seed.zip'
//to the project folder
//OR option 2: 
//write in the Cmd: npm install -g angular-cli and search for the other commands  needed
//4.enter to the folder of the project (angular2 -seed) in the Cmd : cd angular2-seed
//and install all packages writed in the package.json file by writing: npm install
//5.in the package.json you can see in "scripts" -"start" that enable us to write:
//npm start command that will :
//* run typescript Compiler (that will generate the ts files to js files)
//* start the lite web server
//so write in the cmd : npm start (that will run the server)
